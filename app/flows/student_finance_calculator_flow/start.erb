  This calculator is for students living in England starting a new undergraduate course in academic years:
  - 2023 to 2024
  - 2024 to 2025
  
  You'll need to [check if you're eligible for tuition fees and living costs (full support) or tuition fee-only funding before you start](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/who-qualifies).
  
  Use this calculator to estimate:
  - how much student loan you could get
  - extra funding, for example if you’re disabled or have children
  
  Your result will be more accurate if you know your annual household income (your parents’ or partner’s income plus your own).

  You must check what loans you’re eligible for before you start.
  
  If you’re a part-time student you’ll need to know how many credits you’ll study and how many credits a full-time student would study.
  
  You cannot use the calculator if you’re from [Scotland](http://www.saas.gov.uk/), [Wales](http://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/) or [Northern Ireland](http://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/).
